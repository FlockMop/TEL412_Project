This project was part of the undergraduate course TEL 412 that took place
in the Technical University of Crete School of Electronics and Computer
Engineering. The goal of the project was to coordinate the movement of 2-4
cars in the 2-D plane in order to create specific shapes. In order to
achieve that goal we used a camera for the car localization, the Silicon
Laboratories microcontroller C8051F320 with the embedded radio Texas
Instruments CC2500 (nodes) for matlab to master node serial communication
and master node to the car-slave nodes communication.


The main module is the TEL412_Project.m file 
We have used a specific camera (creative Live! chat 720p) and 
You must set it up properly in a space withought obstacles (We used the cameras drivers and programm to set it up NOT matlab)
Also in different light and background conditions you must change the color thresholds
